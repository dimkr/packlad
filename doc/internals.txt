Each packlad package consists of three parts:
  - A compressed tar archive
  - A 4-byte, big-endian magic number (0x686a6b6c, "hjkl" in ASCII)
  - A 64-byte Ed25519 digital signature

The package format does not contain metadata, because it's nothing but means of
fast and secure file transfer.

Instead, package metadata is represented in a "package entry", the most basic
entity. Each package, available or installed, is represented by an entry. It's a
text line in the following format:

  packlad|1.0|A package manager|packlad-1.0.pkg|x86_64|libarchive curl zlib

The line contains package metadata fields separated by "|":
  - The package name
  - The package version
  - The package description
  - The package path under the repository, relative to its root
  - The package target architecture, or "all" if it's architecture-independent
  - The package dependencies, separated by spaces

This format was chosen because:
  - It's textual, so the entry can be edited by hand
  - Everything is stuffed in one line, so parsing is easy
  - It's convenient for shell scripts

A packlad repository contains packages and a package list, which is a text file
that consists of multiple package entries that carry the package metadata:

  zlib|1.2.8|A compression library|zlib-1.2.8.pkg|x86_64|
  packlad|1.0|A package manager|packlad-1.0.pkg|x86_64|libarchive curl zlib
  .
  .
  .

When packlad updates the package list (-u), it reads the repository URL from the
REPO environment variable and downloads the package list from $REPO/available to
/var/packlad/available.

Then, when it installs a package, it locates the requested package and its
dependencies in the package list, recursively. Once all packages are found,
they are downloaded from the repository to /var/packlad/downloaded, using the
the relative path specified in their entries.

Once a package is downloaded, packlad verifies its digital signature using
/etc/packlad/pub_key, extracts it and puts two files under
/var/packlad/installed/$name:
  - "files", which contains the list of files installed by the package
  - "entry", which contains the package entry with an extra field that specifies
    who initiated the package installation. Its value must be one of:
      - "user": the user installed the package
      - "core": the package is a core package
      - "dependency": the package was pulled in by another package

    packlad performs automatic removal of unneeded packages and this field
    specifies whether the new package can be removed and how:
      - "core" packages cannot be removed
      - "user" are never removed automatically, but can be removed by the user
      - "dependency" are removed automatically, but cannot be removed by the
        user

    Also, a "user" package which is a dependency of another package cannot be
    removed.

When a package is removed, all files under the file list are deleted,
/var/packlad/installed/$name is removed and all unneeded dependencies are
removed automatically.
