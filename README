Overview
========

packlad is a lightweight, permissively-licensed package manager for Linux
(https://www.kernel.org/) distributions.

IT'S UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT and NOT READY FOR USE.

It tries to combine:
  - The speed and robustness of pacman (https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/)
  - Digitally-signed packages
  - Easy creation of repositories, as with createrepo
    (http://createrepo.baseurl.org/) and PPM (http://bkhome.org/woof/ppm.htm)
  - The "autoremove" feature of Apt (https://wiki.debian.org/Apt)
  - The ability to extract PPM's (http://bkhome.org/woof/ppm.htm) PET packages
    on any distribution (using standard command-line tools), despite of their
    custom format

packlad is the successor to packdude (https://github.com/dimkr/packdude). It's
simpler, since it uses old-fashioned text files instead of SQLite
(https://sqlite.org/) databases.

In addition, it's more secure, since it supports digitally-signed packages.

Features
========

  - Package download and installation, with recursive dependencies resolution
  - Package removal, with automatic cleanup of unneeded packages
  - Support for multiple package repositories
  - Support for digitally-signed packages, with quick verification
  - Support for multiple compression algorithms

Dependencies
============

packlad depends on:
  - libarchive (http://libarchive.org/) with lzip
    (http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzip.html), XZ (http://tukaani.org/xz/) and
    gzip (https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) support
  - libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/)
  - zlib (http://www.zlib.net/)
  - ed25519 (bundled in the sources tree)

Usage
=====

  - Build packlad using make.
  - To create packages, place their files in directories and run dir2pkg for
    each. The keys you should use are the ones under libpkg/.
  - Then, create a package list with lines in the following format:

      packlad|1.0|A package manager|packlad-1.0.pkg|x86_64|libarchive curl zlib

    The field meanings are self-explanatory.
  - Upload the packages and the package list to a server (which speaks any
    protocol supported by libcurl). Make sure the package list is named
    "pkg_list".
  - Distribute packlad to the end-user, with the repository URL under the "REPO"
    environment variable. Make sure you keep the private key to yourself.

Directory Structure
===================

  - "doc" contains documentation
  - "compat" contains compatibility and portability code
  - "ed25519" contains the Ed25519 digital signature library
  - "keygen" contains a key generator that generates packlad's private and
    public keys
  - "pkgsign" contains a package signing tool
  - "dir2pkg" contains a script that generates a signed package from a directory
  - "core" contains packlad's core: low-level package manager building blocks
  - "logic" contains packlad's high-level, complex operations, built using
    multiple modules of the core
  - "packlad" contains packlad itself

TODO
====

  - A lock file, to disallow multiple instances running in parallel
  - Design docs
  - Automatic blackbox tests?
  - Unit tests for low-level stuff
  - Migrate RLSD from packdude to packlad

FAQ
===

  'packlad'? Are you serious?
  ----------------------------

  Yes. It's like pacman (https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/) and packdude, but
  smaller and younger.

  What's so bad about packdude?
  -----------------------------

  - It's complicated. I mean, the code.
  - Databases are binary and cannot be edited by hand.
  - packdude's repositories contain a database. This database is created using
    a tool that converts a CSV file to a SQLite database. Keeping the
    human-readable CSV file in sync with the database is simply annoying and
    error-prone.
  - It doesn't support signed packages.
  - It doesn't allow the user when to update the package database.
  - It supports only XZ compression.

  What's good about packdude?
  ---------------------------

  - It was small and fast. Package installation was quick.
  - The automatic cleanup feature worked amazingly well.
  - Its package format was great. tar and XZ Utils handle archiving and
    compression pretty well, so using existing technologiesw was a good choice.
    Also, the package header was located after a XZ-compressed tar archive, so
    it was possible to extract packdude's packages with xz and tar. That was
    pretty convenient. This is definitely a keeper.
